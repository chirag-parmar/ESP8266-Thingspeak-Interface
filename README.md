### ESP8266-Thingspeak-Interface
Arduino Program that sends and receives data to and from Thingspeak Account using a ESP8266-01 board. It basically uses the ESP8266 as a HTTP client placing POST and GET requests to the thingspeak server. A response a received as payload and this payload is parsed to get the field values.

**NOTE: ** *you must create a thingspeak account and generate a API Key inorder to exceute the program.*

*will shortly update with a interface diagram to program the ESP8266*
